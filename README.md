## Workouts

### TODO's

- Set up testing with playwright
  - Auth tests: https://authjs.dev/guides/testing#credentials-provider-in-development
- Explore i18n
- Local environment workflow
  - Finish DB setup (creating dynamodb tables)
  - Mock SES responses (maybe logging to console or saving
    email content to a dynamodb table). The email could be saved with an ID
    so it can be retrieved later for testing.
